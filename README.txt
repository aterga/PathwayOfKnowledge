"The Pathway of Knowledge"
--------------------------

Initially created at SkolTech Hackathon 2.0

First of all, we thaught that info-structuring is currently underrated.

To understand a schientific article we have to go through all of its references. And this is totally ineffective.

We offer a much more efficient solution by giving the minimal reading list required for getting into the paper.

When we study, we really need the links between pieces of knowledge. Without them we don't get feedback and directions to proceed.

Now, here are the tree steps:
1. asking the user about the articles she read and well understood;
2. and that she is trying to understand;
3. giving the right sequence of articles for the user to develop the understanding from poin A to B

The potential business models include integration into systems like Elsevier, Web of Schience and so on. 
Finally, recrouting companies are also highly interested in our statistical data.
